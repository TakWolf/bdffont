    # The scalable width in x and y of character. Scalable widths are in units of 1/1000th of the size of
    # the character. If the size of the character is p points, the width information must be scaled by p/1000
    # to get the width of the character in printer’s points. This width information should be considered as a
    # vector indicating the position of the next character’s origin relative to the origin of this character.
    # To convert the scalable width to the width in device pixels, multiply s_width times p/1000 times r/72,
    # where r is the device resolution in pixels per inch. The result is a real number giving the ideal print
    # width in device pixels. The actual device width must of course be an integral number of device pixels and
    # is given in the next entry. The s_width y value should always be zero for a standard X font.
    s_width: (int, int)

    # The width in x and y of the character in device units. Like the s_width, this width information is a vector
    # indicating the position of the next character’s origin relative to the origin of this character. Note that
    # the d_width of a given "hand-tuned" WYSIWYG glyph may deviate slightly from its ideal device-independent width
    # given by s_width in order to improve its typographic characteristics on a display. The d_width y value should
    # always be zero for a standard X font.
    d_width: (int, int)

    # The width in x (BBw), height in y (BBh), and x and y displacement (BBox, BBoy) of the lower left corner from
    # the origin of the character.
